Welcome to DashCraft. This is a machine learning project for UCI's CS 175 class based off Microsoft's Project Malmo. Project Malmo utilizes the game Minecraft to create an environment in which programmers can develop and experiment with different machine learning algorithms. We've developed an agent, named DashCraft, whose goal is to deliver food to various houses in the most efficient way possible. To do so, it most explore and learn the map, considering rewards it can gain by visiting houses in different orders. DashCraft is inspired by the popular food delivery app DoorDash.
