## Summary of the Project

DashCraft, the agent, was just hired by a delivery company. His goal is to explore the map and make deliveries in the shortest time possible. For each successful delivery, he will receive money as a reward. If he fails to find his destination or is unable to complete a delivery in a given time, the agent will not get paid for that delivery.
The input is the location of store/place where he picks up goods and the location of the final destination where the goods will be delivered. The agent should find a path and return this path. Eventually, after training, the agent should consistently output the shortest path possible.
